# Welcome!

Hello, beloved human being! Thanks a lot for taking the time to work on our code assignment ❤️

As described on the slide deck that should have been shared with you, we'd like you to work a small code assignment. Its description in further detail can be found at [this document](./data-science-movie-mate-code-assignment.md)

This repository is just a boilerplate, a starting point for you. As you might have already seen, it doesn't contain much and that's on purpose. We don't want to limit your creativity. Feel free to explore the problem and come up with the best solution you can think of! 

# Should I do anything with this README?

Yes! As described on the slide deck, we'd like you to prepare some documentation around...
- how the algorithm works at a high level
- how would you assess the overall quality of the recommendations
- possible improvements you can think of

# Am I supposed to deliver everything described in the slide deck?

Not at all :) We know everyone has limitations on how much time they can invest on a coding challenge, and we're conscious that no one knows everything. Maybe you don't know how to implement a HTTP API. Or maybe you don't have enough time to research into all the possible models to use on a solution. Just let us know about the limitations of your solution and we'll talk about them on the code review session :)

Good luck! We hope you enjoy working on this task. And if you need anything at all, please feel free to reach out to us!
